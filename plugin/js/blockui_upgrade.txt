blockUI has the same z-index as exhibit's popups.  If you upgrade blockUI,
change

    // z-index for the blocking overlay
    baseZ: 1000,
    
to

    // z-index for the blocking overlay
    baseZ: 500,

or something smaller than 1000.  Otherwise, the lightbox will overrule some
exhibit popups.
